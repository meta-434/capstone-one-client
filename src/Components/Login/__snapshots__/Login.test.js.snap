        By working on a specific task in 25 minute increments, with 5 minute breaks, your work sessions never lack in direction. Every 4 work sessions, take a longer break. 20 minutes, maybe 30. This time will help you rest before you next round.

        By reviewing tracking your Pomodoro sessions, you increase your accountability - you want to be able to put something down as completed. By referring to your past Pomodoro sessions, you can see your progress as you work through your sessions.

        Keep formulae, phone numbers, or just encouraging thoughts - your most recent note will be displayed on the timer page for reference during work sessions. Notes can only be modified from the notes tab as to not distract the user during work sessions. Remember to set your notes before you start the timer!
